noosfere is a database of books, volumes, covers, authors, translators,
cover designers, critics, critic's author, movies adaptation... noosfere is
NOT commercial, it is the DB of an association of authors, readers,
editors... see about.txt last but not least noosfere is in french ONLY:
noosfere defines itself as "nooSFere : encyclopédie francophone de
Science-Fiction."

Definition: A volume has in common with a book the author and the title but
not the cover, not the editor, not the isbn, not.. I want the information
about a volume... I want a coherent information. I hate swapping the cover
of a volume with that of another one because "it's nicer".

In order to collect the information about a volume one must use either the
ISBN, the author and the title. Because of that, author and title should be
as accurate as possible, or rather as similar as possible to noosfere...
(that is a hint: when it fails got to noosfere manualy, if the book exists
there, copy paste isbn, author and title in calibre, pay attention to the
order of the author's first name and LAST NAME)

If the ISBN exists a search in noosfere points to a serie of volumes (yet
only one book :-) )

If the author is the best known identifier a search in noosfere points to an
author's list of books (or a list of authors :-( ) out of this list, a match
to the title will point to a serie of volumes

If the title is the only reference, a search in noosfere will output a list
of books sorted by best mactch along with a score again a book will point to
a serie of volume. (In theory, it is yet to be implemented...

Out of the volume list one must choose the best candidate to get a coherent
set of volumes attributes (cover, isbn, editor, critics, serie, serie nbr,
etc...


The nice think about noosfere is the power of the search (each word may be
"ANDed, exact or fuzzy match, etc...) The result gives a LOT of information
about the book, author, translator... And the nice think about calibre is
the possibility to insert working url in the comments and in the catalogs..
Thanks for that.

File worker.py is NOT stricly needed (read absolutely useless as I very
often reduce the match to ONE book) but it was nice to develop so I learned
how to create spawned process... :-)

REGISTERIT.BAT will create a zip file that will be pushed to the righ
place... It must be invoked any time a change is done to a .py file.

TESTIT.BAT will bost register and execute some testing (usefull when
debuging an url that behave differently (read when it displays one of my
bugs leftover)

This is a beta version (alpha is I guess when only me can make it work...).
Beta version translate to "c'est juste une bête version"... For the english
speaking people, this is a very very funny word play in french... all right,
at least it makes me laugh, even if I am the only one...

I still need to add some custom columns but I have not decided if I need to
design a config program in a window...

I have to decide how to give me the possiblity to choose what volume I want
in calibre... here: from preference, metadata download, (tickbox) Keep more
than one entry per source, the comment says: "Disable any metadata sources
you do not want by unchecking them. You can also set the cover priority.
Covers from sources that have a higher (smaller) priority will be preferred
when bulk downloading metadata.". Could I have lrpid to differenciate
different volumes of a same book??

ouch... bad surprise, noosfere find so many match to "G.-J. Arnaud"... even
with 'exact' match...I need to find a better way to filter the author list
provided... done: use from difflib import SequenceMatcher and swapping first
and last name before comparison

lrpid is nice for a unique id produced with time, but I guess I could use
the book or the voluem url as an id... (and maybe give a less self pointing
name to the id name)... I use both the book and the volume noosfere's
identifier (bk$<book-number-in-noosfere>$vl$<vol-number-in-noosfere>). With
that info, I can reach immediately to the book and/or to the volume, and
each volume gets a unique nsfr_id

Introduced (via calibre Options) a boolean to expand or not the publisher
field. Now, publisher contains publisher§collection name€serial code. § and €
used because very low probability to exist. Metadata bulk edit created to
help push the data to the right place.

Introduced (via calibre Options) a number to select the debug level

Introduced (via calibre Options) a choice to select how to push the priority
to get oldest or latest with or without preference over volume with ISBN.
Caution, this still choose the most verbose comments.

Introduced (via calibre Options) a string box. Filled with the (exact!!)
publisher name, it pushes priority to give a match on publisher name... Yes,
I know that the collection may still be wrong. The only way is to change the
nsfr_id to reflect what volume of the book we really want (the number,
including the sign if any, after the equal sign should show up glued to the
vl$<number>) and restart the metadata download.

Pushed to version 0,7,0 after refactoring some code to become function instead
of method...

Corrected instructions cause some volume have no value for coll_rsl, yet they 
have a value for collection...

Intention:
access each book in book_index and determine if several volume exists funtion 
of returned url address (url_vrai) if several volume, get each and every 
url_adrres and pass it to extract_vol_detail for each ref found...
We may get lucky and NOT combine those even if title, author and isbn are 
identical... nsfr_id will be different... hopefully this is enough ( I could 
not find the associated code in the sources)
Besides this could help insert a "manual choice via  Qwebengine"... of course 
using a file as feedback and sync since spawed process and queue do not work 
in calibre (I cannot make it work, I mean :-o)
