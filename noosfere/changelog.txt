# noosfere is a database of books, volumes, covers, authors, translators, cover designers, critics, critic's author, movies adaptation...
# noosfere is NOT commercial, it is the DB of an association of authors, readers, editors... see about.txt
# last but not least noosfere is in french ONLY: noosfere defines itself as "nooSFere : encyclopédie francophone de Science-Fiction."
#
# A volume has in common with a book the author and the title but not the cover, not the editor, not the isbn, not.."
# I want the information about a volume... I want a coherent information.
#
# In order to collect the information about a volume one must use either the ISBN, the author and the title or at least the title
#
# If the ISBN exists a search in noosfere points to a serie of volumes (yet only one book :-) )
#
# if the author is the best known identifier a search in noosfere points to an author's list of books (or a list of authorss :-( )
# out of this list, a match to the title will point to a serie of volumes
#
# if the title is the only reference, a search in noosfere will output a list of books sorted by best mactch along with a score
# again a book will point to a serie of volume
#
# out of the volume list one must choose the best candidate to get a coherent set of volumes attributes (cover, isbn, editor, critics, serie, serie #, etc...
#
#
# the nice think about noosfere is the power of the search (each word may be "ANDed, exact or fuzzy match, etc...)
# the result gives a LOT of information about the book, author, translator...
# and the nice think about calibre is the possibility to insert working url in the comments and in the catalog
#
#
# File worker.py is NOT stricly needed (read absolutely useless) but it was nice to develop so I learned how to create spawned process... :-)
#
# REGISTERIT.BAT will create a zip file that will be pushed to the righ place... It must be invoked any time a change is done to a .py file.
#
# TESTIT.BAT will bost register and execute some testing (usefull when debuging an url that behave differently (read when it displays one of my bugs leftover)
#
# This is a beta version (alpha is I guess when only me can make it work...). I mean "c'est juste une bête version"... 
# For the english speaking people, this is a very very funny word play in french... all right, at least it makes me laugh, even if I am the only one...
# 
# I still need to add some custom columns but I have not decided if I need to design a config program  in a window...
#
# I have to decide how to give me the possiblity to choose what volume I want in calibre... 
#     de preference, metadata download, (tickbox) Keep more than one entry per source, read comment: 
"Disable any metadata sources you do not want by unchecking them. You can also set the cover priority. 
Covers from sources that have a higher (smaller) priority will be preferred when bulk downloading metadata.". 
# Could I have lrpid to differenciate different volumes of a same book?? 
#
# ouch... mauvaise surprise, noosfere trouve beaucoup trop d'auteur correspondant a "G.-J. Arnaud"...
# meme en recherche exacte... on obtient 84 réponses avec la meme pertinence de 160...
